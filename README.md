# SimpliWeather

Simpli Weather is an app I have been working on for the better part of a year. Simpli Weather uses two APIs currently, and is developed using UIKit. Forecast
and current weather alerts are pulled directly from the National Weather Service. Then we use Open Weather for current conditions for each location in the U.S., since the NWS does not build out forecasts for international cities. Any search for international city will result in an error.
