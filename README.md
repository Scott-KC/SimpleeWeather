# SimpliWeather

Simpli Weather is an app I have been working on for the better part of a year. Simpli Weather uses two APIs currently, and is developed using UIKit. Forecast
and current weather alerts are pulled directly from the National Weather Service. Then we use Open Weather for current conditions for each location in the U.S., since the NWS does not build out forecasts for international cities. Any search for international city will result in an error. 

# Roadmap 
The app itself does just about all of the functions that it needs. However, I do want to implement a radar at some point. 

# Privacy
The only time we retrieve your location is when we are looking for weather. Once your location is found, either by city, state search or using the location button we stop updating your location. This is then sent over the internet to our APIs so that we can grab your weather conditions. This information is never saved to a server. If you do not feel comfortable with us using your phone's location to pull in your area please know that you may always use the search bar instead.
